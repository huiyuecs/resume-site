## Experience

### Software Development Engineer Intern
**UT Southwestern Medical Center** | Jun. 2025 – Aug. 2025

- Modernized a genomic analytics platform supporting 50+ researchers, improving data workflows and system performance for large-scale sequencing analysis.
- Designed and built distributed backend services in Python/FastAPI to process 5TB+ of genomic data (20M+ records), increasing data-ingestion throughput by 30% compared to the prior manual pipeline.
- Deployed scalable microservices on AWS EC2/S3/RDS and automated workflows via GitHub Actions CI/CD.
- Implemented CloudWatch-based monitoring for query latency and optimized SQL queries to improve reliability and reduce downtime.
- Collaborated cross-functionally in Agile sprints; contributed to design reviews, documentation, and on-call troubleshooting.

### Software Development Engineer Intern
**Suncool Network Technology** | Sep. 2024 – Dec. 2024

- Contributed to backend development for an e-government platform serving 2M+ active users.
- Developed Spring Boot REST APIs for document tracking and digital ID validation, cutting response latency by 40%.
- Built real-time internal dashboards using React and data-visualization APIs, rendering PostgreSQL data with millisecond latency and consistently meeting SLA requirements. Implemented asynchronous event processing via a message queue and added caching layers to reduce load spikes and maintain 99.8% system uptime.
- Participated in Agile/Scrum ceremonies, performing QA verification and issue resolution aligned with production SLAs.

## Projects

### PayRouteSim — Distributed Payment Routing Engine
**Technologies:** Java, Spring Boot, FastAPI, Kafka, K8s

- Built a distributed simulation platform modeled after VisaNet flows, processing 120K+ events/min with deterministic latency.
- Orchestrated microservices using Docker + Kubernetes with horizontal auto-scaling and pod health checks for 99.9% reliability.
- Designed Kafka pipelines for fraud checks and settlement with end-to-end latency under 45ms.
- Integrated Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for SRE-style monitoring of latency percentiles and throughput.

### TaskPilot AI — GenAI Developer Productivity Platform
**GitHub** | [View Project](https://github.com)

- Developed a GenAI-powered assistant integrating OpenAI GPT API with Express + React + Redux to automate issue triage and code summarization. Integrated GitHub APIs for real-time pull request analysis and task assignment, improving team productivity by 35%.
- Containerized the system using Docker and deployed via CI/CD pipelines, cutting deployment time by 50%. Adopted clean code principles, implemented Jest unit tests, and followed SDLC best practices in an Agile workflow.
